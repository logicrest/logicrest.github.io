# **Logic.rest documentation**
With this documentation site, You can learn how to use our endpoints. Some of our endpoints will require an [API Key](https://tokens.logic.rest) to use but Don't fret! They are completely free to get.


### Rate Limits
We have ratelimits on our API to keep everybodys experience smooth, This ratelimit is 100 requests per hour by default for people with and without API Tokens.
